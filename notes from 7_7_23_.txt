need to create some json boundry files.

main campus
north campus

work on an alf to take list of baseball home plates and create plots of the surrounding acre or so

don't want to use circles - probably. figure out way to get a consitant frame that preserves scale

-- create color scheme - should be able to pass lovrary of school colors to each plot

-- big thing will be creating the different color profiles and figuring out how to feed new values for each plot based on school / team colors
